Weta
=======
Files related to the Weta Project - a low cost educational robotics system.
This project started as my version of Babuino (https://github.com/murray-lang/Babuino) but I changed the name to remove any suggestion that it was related to Arduino.

Most of what is in the README for that project still holds, but much work has been done to make the virtual machine cross-platform.

The work is currently in flux, and the only version of the VM that will build is for the ESP32.

Previous versions for Arduino and ESP8266 will be rebuilt and uploaded soon.
