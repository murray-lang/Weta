        <p>
            Logo's syntax for variable access is quirky and unique. Indeed, to a developer accustomed to modern
            programming languages, it seems daft. However, it should be noted that Logo has its roots in Lisp, which
            is the second oldest high-level programming language after Fortran. Its authors did not have the benefit
            of the decades of experience with parsers and grammar definition processors that we can call upon today.
            There were certainly no tools such as Lex and Yacc available to make life easier. Indeed, this Logo
            compiler would not exist without <a class="ulink" href="http://jscc.phorward-software.com/" target="_top">JS/CC</a> to do
            the parsing work.
        </p>
        <p>
            This article aims to demystify the use of variables in Logo so
            that code samples can be understood, and the Language used more effectively.

            <p>Here is the simplest case of assigning a value to a variable:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
            make "foo 43
            </pre>
            <p>
                Firstly it should be noted that variables in Logo need not be declared before use.
                This is a grammatically complete, albeit useless, Logo program.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only surprise in this example is the <span class="command"><strong>"</strong></span> preceding <span class="command"><strong>foo</strong></span>.
                In Logo parlance, <span class="command"><strong>"foo</strong></span> means the "name of foo", though it might be more
                useful to consider <span class="command"><strong>"foo</strong></span> to mean the "location labeled foo". In english, the above
                statement translates to "Put 43 into the location labelled 'foo'". A literal translation
                to C/C++ might be...
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
            *foo = 42;
            </pre>
            <p>
                ...where it is assumed that some preceding code has declared foo to be a pointer to a short, and has
                assigned it the address of an available memory location.
            </p>

        <div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp29284204"></a>Fetching the Value Contained by a Variable</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                There is a long-hand and a short-hand way to fetch the contents of Logo variables. The long-hand way
                will be presented first because it provides some coherence with the variable syntax introduced above.
                Here is how you might assign the value of foo to another variable:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
                make "bar thing "foo
            </pre>
            <p>
                "<span class="command"><strong>thing</strong></span>" means "get the contents of", so the above statement translates into English
                as "Put the contents of the location labelled 'foo' into the location labelled 'bar'".
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately for the readability of Logo programs, 'thing "foo' can be abbreviated to ':foo' thus:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
                make "bar :foo
            </pre>
            <p>
               Forgetting to include the '"' and ':' is a very common pitfall for developers coming from any other
                programming language. To make things worse, there are circumstances where neither prefix is used,
                for example in the iterator declarations of <a href="../reference/a-z/for.html" class="olink">for</a> and
                <a href="../reference/a-z/foreach.html" class="olink">foreach</a>. Note however that the contents of these iterator variables
                are accessed in the usual way - for example with the nextPort variable here:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">
                for [nextPort 0 3 1]
                [
                    send tostring analogin :nextPort
                ]
            </pre>
        </div>
