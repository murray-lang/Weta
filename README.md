Weta
=======
Files related to the Weta Project - a low cost educational robotics system.
This project started as my version of Babuino (https://github.com/murray-lang/Babuino) but I changed the name to remove any suggestion that it was related to Arduino.

Most of what is in the README for that project still holds, but much work has been done to make the virtual machine cross-platform.

The work is currently in flux. 
The VM will build for the ESP32 and ESP8266.
It also builds for AVR Arduinos using CMake, but there is more work to do with flash storage as the Arduino flash api overlaps with mine.
